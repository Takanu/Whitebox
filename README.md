# Whitebox
Whitebox is a small set of simple tools and assets designed to help level designers best use Blender.  While i’ve built this for my current work in Unity and VRChat this can be used for any game engine.


## What does this do?
This project comes with 3 sets of tools:

• A set of materials and textures used for creating grids and measuring systems.  Use these to describe objects visually and to set the right level of measurements for the surfaces in your scene.

• An addon that adds quick grid size adjustment options in the 3D View (under the Sidebar > View > Grids, pin it!), as well as quick keymap shortcuts for grid adjustments and for activating Walk Navigation, which will make the Viewport camera act just like the one in Unreal and Unity.

• A set of 3D objects that can be used for quick measurement references when building scenes or other similark kinds of objects.


## Why Blender?
When it comes to making simple prototypes (or, “whiteboxing”), Blender is both a faster and more versatile tool because unlike Unreal, Unity and it’s ProBuilder addon, it’s a robust 3D modelling app with lots of features, full keyboard shortcuts. great measurement tools and better ways to visualize and organize your work.

For architectural designs you also need more precise measurements and shapes that neither of these apps are equipped to deal with.

Combined with my other addon [Capsule](https://github.com/Takanu/Capsule), you can export your level designs to the game engine of your choice with a single click.
