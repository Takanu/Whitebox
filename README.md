# Whitebox
Whitebox is a small set of simple tools and assets designed to help level designers best use Blender.  While i’ve built this for my current work in Unity and VRChat this can be used for any game engine.

This repository also contains a wiki to help those who know nothing about Blender get started with this kit as well as other suggestions for tools and techniques you can use when building levels.


## What does this do?
This project comes with 3 sets of tools:

• An addon that adds quick grid size adjustment options in the 3D View (under the Sidebar > View > Grids, pin it!), as well as quick keymap shortcuts for grid adjustments and for activating Walk Navigation, which will make the Viewport camera act just like the one in Unreal and Unity.

• A Blender Startup file that contains a set of workspaces optimized for creating level designs.

• A set of materials and textures used for creating grid textures.  Use these to describe objects visually and set the right size of grid for different types of objects in your scene.


## Why Blender?
When it comes to making simple prototypes (or, “whiteboxing”), Blender is both a faster and more versatile tool because unlike Unreal, Unity and it’s ProBuilder addon, it’s a robust 3D modelling app with lots of features, full keyboard shortcuts. great measurement tools and better ways to visualize and organize your work.

For architectural designs you also need more precise measurements and shapes that neither of these apps are equipped to deal with.

• Maebbie for the original grid script and startup file and for additional feedback.

• pitiwazou and kilbee for some AddonPreferences keymap code that the addon is based on.
